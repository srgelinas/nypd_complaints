    "### Getting the Data\n",
    "The data and its corresponding data dictionary is downloadable [here](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you don't need to provide any information to obtain the data. Just agree to the terms of use and click \"submit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "A classifier was trained to predict whether or not an NYPD officer was disciplined after a complaint was\n",
    "filed against them. For our target variable, we binarized the board disposition column into officers who were\n",
    "disciplined after their complaint (1) and officers who weren't (0). We chose this target variable because we\n",
    "wanted to see which features could have been responsible for an officer getting disciplinary action after having\n",
    "a complaint filed against them. For our evaluation metric, we used the percent of predictions that were correct.\n",
    "In this case, overall accuracy is the right metric to use because there is no extra harm in a false positive when\n",
    "compared to a false negative result, especially since our dataset is not class-imbalanced. Both mistakes will be\n",
    "weighed the same in our accuracy model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The baseline model has 9 features: 2 that are quantitative, 1 that is ordinal, and 6 that are nominal. As stated in\n",
    "the introduction, for our evaluation metric we used the % accuracy and with our baseline model we got 74.40%\n",
    "accuracy, which was not good because this is about the same accuracy (if not lower) than if we had an extreme\n",
    "model that just guessed 0 (no disciplinary action taken) each time which had 75.81% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "The features we added were the age difference between the officer and the complainant and also the duration\n",
    "that each complaint was open. For the age difference between the officer and the complainant, we chose to add\n",
    "this because not only did it combine the information for 2 columns that were in the original data (the age of the\n",
    "complainant and the age of the officer), we felt like it would be more likely for someone to file a complaint if the\n",
    "violating officer was younger than them or close to them in age. In this type of situation, the complainant might\n",
    "feel like they have more authority over the police officer than if the complainant was much younger than their\n",
    "arresting officer. As for the complaint duration, we felt like this would positively impact our model because cases\n",
    "that were closed faster were likely taken more seriously than those that were open for longer periods of time\n",
    "because they were investigated immediately and we felt like this would also reflect itself in the disciplinary\n",
    "actions agasint the violating officers.\n",
    "For our model we chose a Decision Tree Classifier because almost all of our features were categorical. For\n",
    "parameters that worked best with our model, running grid search showed that the ideal max_depth parameter\n",
    "was 20 and the ideal min_samples_leaf parameter was 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "An'interesting subset' we analyzed was the column containing each police officer's rank at the time the\n",
    "complaint was closed and we binarized it based on whether the police officer's rank was just a regular police\n",
    "officer (the lowest possible rank in the NYPD) (True) or whether the officer's rank was higher (False). We wanted\n",
    "to see whether our model was fairer towards regular police officers or their superiors. The reason we chose this\n",
    "column was because it was the most important feature in our model when making predictions.\n",
    "For our parity measure, we picked accuracy because we noticed that our model's predictions for officers who\n",
    "were disciplined were artificially low, so we wanted to see whether this held true for all ranking officers. These\n",
    "were our hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis:** the classifier is fair; the precision for cops with the rank 'Police Officer' and for cops who don't have the rank 'Police Officer' is the same\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alternative Hypothesis:** the classifier is unfair; the precision for the cops with the rank 'Police Officer' is different than the precision for cops who don't have the rank 'Police Officer'\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we ran a permutation test at the 0.05 significance level to see whether we reject or fail to reject the\n",
    "null hypothesis. We ended up with a p-value of 0.0, meaning that we reject our null hypothesis and predict that\n",
    "the classifier is fair towards cops with the rank 'Police Officer'."
